# Hot Cargo playtest checklist

Manual checks that the autotests do not cover. Start a new single-player career with the Hot Cargo mod on and debug keys on
(F9 adds 10 heat, F10 starts the next stage, F11 / Shift+F11 add or remove 1 tech).
To see each tactic decision in `hot_cargo_log.txt`, put `Tactics { DebugLog = true }` in `tunables.rules`.
Mission checks are in [tests/playtest/missions.md](tests/playtest/missions.md).

## Tech

1. Look at the starting ship. Check that a tinted 2×2 Tech Vault replaces one storage bay, and that its stacks show 6 units.
2. Start a career with the Model-M starter ship. Check that the vault is outside the hull with a door, and that crew can walk to it.
3. Open the build menu, Storage group. Check that "Tech Vault" is there with its name, description and tinted icon.
4. Dock at a trade station and open the trade window. Check that "Stolen Tech" shows the overlay tech value as its sell price.
5. Sell 1 unit through the trade window. Check that the money rises by the shown price and the overlay tech count drops by 1.
6. In the trade window, check that the station offers the sold unit back at 1.5 × the sell price.
7. Try to move tech into a normal storage bay with the transfer window. Check that the game refuses it.
8. Let an enemy shoot the vault. Check that the stacks shrink as it takes damage, and that repair does not bring them back.
9. Sell the last unit. Check that the loss dialog "The corporation recovered the tech." shows about 3 seconds after the delivery.
10. Press F11 and Shift+F11. Check that the overlay tech count goes up and down by 1.

## Hunters and tactics (spec 30-35, 43-49)

1. Press F10 four times, a few seconds apart. Each stage shows its message at the top of the screen and plays the wanted alert.
2. Each wave comes in from one side with the FTL jump-in effect. Do the ships appear far enough away (2,000 to 3,000)? Is one side per wave readable?
3. Hunters show the "Corporate" name prefix. Is that enough to tell them apart from pirates and police? If not, a colored name or icon needs C# work.
4. Hunters are enemies of faction ships too (like vanilla ambushes). Do police or stations kill hunters too easily? If yes, say so: hunters can be made neutral to factions with a patch.
5. Hunt stage (tier + 1) and Strike stage (tier + 2) at sector 1: is the Strike stage survivable (spec 35) or a sure loss?
6. Pincer: with two or more hunters, do they split and come from different sides? Does the formation turning every 10 to 20 s look natural or twitchy?
7. Kite: a hunter with longer range holds at a fixed distance and backs off when you close in. Is it readable? Is it annoying? Lower `KiteRangeFraction` makes it hold closer.
8. Disable (Hunt and Strike): do your guns and engines break first? Do the enemy target lines point at them?
9. Fall back: shoot a hunter to about a third of its value. Does it turn and run, then sit still and repair? Does it come back? Is the 45 s limit too long?
10. Bait (Strike): does one small ship dive in alone and then run back to the group? Is it clear enough that chasing it is a trap?
11. Save during a fight with hunters, load, and check that the fight continues the same way.
12. With the Tech area merged: hunters prefer the ship with the Tech Vault (`VaultTargetFactor`). Put the vault on a second ship and check that hunters switch to it.
